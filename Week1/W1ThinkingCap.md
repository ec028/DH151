## What is the site's agenda?
The site's agenda is to provide a reference for different tourist, lodging, and eating locations throughout Europe. It also acts as a way to plan routes for trips throughout Europe, taking into account traffic and the ability to look at as many attractions as possible.

## Why does this website “speak” to you?
I appreciated the visuals that came with the tourist attractions marked on the map; often a waypoint merely has a name/text, but the visuals help trip planners identify if those attractions are actually the correct place they wish to go to. 

## Does the mapping work, and does it “work?” i.e., in your opinion, does it do what it’s supposed to do?
I think the mapping works in both senses in that it helps people plan for trips. There's also the review system, which will help visitors figure out which places are possibly worth including in an itinerary, and which aren't. 

## What technologies does the map use? I.e. Google maps, leaflet, mapbox, etc?
It uses a TomTom map, and Michelin's own data to source where the tourist attractions, hotels, traffic, and eateries are. The latter is predictable since this map was created by the Michelin organization/company in the first place.

## If you could change something, what would it be?
Because the site offers so many functions, I feel that the website is a bit messy. I think the four categories of organization/objects offered (traffic, restaurants, hotels, sightseeing) could be pushed to a sidebar or take up less spaces somehow. I would also would like to see more categories for filtering, such as a system that is country-based.
