## What is the site's agenda?
The site's agenda is to provide a reference for different tourist, lodging, and eating locations throughout Europe. It also acts as a way to plan routes for trips throughout Europe, taking into account traffic and the ability to look at as many attractions as possible.

## Why does this website “speak” to you?
I appreciated the visuals that came with the tourist attractions marked on the map; often a waypoint merely has a name/text, but the visuals help trip planners identify if those attractions are actually the correct place they wish to go to. 

## Does the mapping work, and does it “work?” i.e., in your opinion, does it do what it’s supposed to do?
## What technologies does the map use? I.e. Google maps, leaflet, mapbox, etc?
## If you could change something, what would it be?
