        <!--Paragraph Text here-->
        <p>Hi, my name is <b>Emily</b>, and I'm a <b>English/History</b> major and <b>Digital Humanities</b> minor. I am currently a senior at UCLA. </p>>
        
        <p>My goals for this course primarily involves me being less apprehensive about coding and using coding in my projects. I have some prior experience 
        in <i>Java</i>, <i>Python</i>, and <i>HTML</i>, but I usually struggle quite a lot; my hope is that this class will help me understand how to code/problem-solve better! </p>
