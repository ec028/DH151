        <h1>About Me</h1> 

        <!--Paragraph Text here-->
        <p>Hi, my name is <b>Emily</b>, and I'm a <b>English/History</b> major and <b>Digital Humanities</b> minor. I am currently a senior at UCLA, and I'll be graduating this summer.
        I am currently based in San Diego, California, as it is my hometown. I look forward to meeting and working with everyone throughout this quarter! </p>
        
        <p>My goals for this course primarily involves me being less apprehensive about coding and using coding in my projects. I have some prior experience 
        in <i>Java</i>, <i>Python</i>, and <i>HTML</i>, but I usually struggle quite a lot; 
        my hope is that this class will help me understand how to code/problem-solve better. Ultimately I would like to be able to incorporate coding and digital mapping
        in a way that will act as a tool for the research I do in the humanities. I also hope that by learning how to create visuals, I will be able to present information more 
        effectively to a wider audience. </p>
